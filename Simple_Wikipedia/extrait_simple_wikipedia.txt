'''April''' is the fourth [[month]] of the [[year]], and comes between [[March]] and [[May]]. It is one of four months to have 30 [[day]]s.

April always starts on the same day of week as [[July]], and additionally, [[January]] in leap years. April always ends on the same day of the week as [[December]].

April's [[flower]]s are the [[Sweet Pea]] and [[Asteraceae|Daisy]]. Its [[birthstone]] is the [[diamond]]. The meaning of the diamond is innocence.

== The Month ==
[[File:Colorful spring garden.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Spring]] flowers in April in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].]]
April comes between [[March]] and [[May]], making it the fourth month of the year. It also comes first in the year out of the four months that have 30 days, as [[June]], [[September]] and [[November]] are later in the year.

April starts on the same day of the week as [[July]] every year, and also starts on the same day as [[January]] in [[leap year]]s. April ends on the same day of the week as [[December]] every year.

April of a [[common year]] starts on the same day of the week as [[October]] of the previous year (and also [[January]], if that year also is a common year) and ends on the same day as [[July]] of the previous year.  April of a leap year and a year that follows a leap year ends on the same day of the week as [[January]] of the previous year, while April of a [[leap year]] starts on the same day of the week as [[May]] of the previous year and ends on the same day of the week as [[February]] and [[October]] of the previous year.

In years that precede a [[common year]], April starts on the same day of the week as [[September]] and [[December]], and ends on the same day of the week as [[September]], both of the following year; in years that precede a [[leap year]], April starts on the same day of the week as [[June]], and ends on the same day of the week as [[March]] and [[June]], both of the following year.

April is a [[spring]] month in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and an [[autumn|autumn/fall]] month in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. In each [[hemisphere]], it is the [[season]]al equivalent of [[October]] in the other.

It is unclear as to where April got its name. A common theory is that it comes from the [[Latin]] word &quot;aperire&quot;, meaning &quot;to open&quot;, referring to [[flower]]s opening in [[spring]]. Another theory is that the name could come from [[Aphrodite]], the Greek goddess of [[love]]. It was originally the second month in the old Roman [[Calendar]], before the start of the new year was put to [[January 1]].

Quite a few festivals are held in this month. In many [[Southeast Asia]]n cultures, new year is celebrated in this month (including [[Songkran]]). In Western [[Christianity]], [[Easter]] can be celebrated on a [[Sunday]] between [[March 22]] and [[April 25]]. In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Christianity, it can fall between [[April 4]] and [[May 8]]. At the end of the month, Central and Northern [[Europe]]an [[culture]]s celebrate [[Walpurgis Night]] on [[April 30]], marking the transition from [[winter]] into [[summer]].

== April in poetry ==
[[poetry|Poets]] use ''April'' to mean the end of winter. For example: ''April showers bring [[May]] flowers.''

'''August''' is the eighth [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]], coming between [[July]] and [[September]]. It has 31 [[day]]s, the same number of days as the previous month, [[July]], and is named after Roman Emperor [[Augustus Caesar]].

August doesn't start on the same day of the week as another month in [[Common year|common years]], but starts on the same day of the week as [[February]] in [[Leap year|leap years]].  August always ends on the same day of the week as [[November]].

== The Month ==
[[File:Hw-augustus.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Roman Emperor [[Augustus Caesar]], after whom August is named]]
This month was first called ''[[Sextilis]]'' in [[Latin]], because it was the sixth month in the old [[Roman calendar]]. The Roman calendar began in March about 735 BC with [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]]. [[October]] was the eighth month. August was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King [[Numa Pompilius]] about 700 BC. Or, when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the [[decemvirs]] about 450 BC (Roman writers disagree). In [[153 BC]] [[January 1]] was determined as the beginning of the year.

August is named for [[Augustus Caesar]] who became [[Roman consul]] in this month.&lt;ref name=&quot;infoplease&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title=History of August |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/history-of-august.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The month has 31 days because [[Julius Caesar]] added two days when he created the [[Julian calendar]] in [[45 BC]]. August is after July and before September.

August, in either [[hemisphere]], is the seasonal equivalent of [[February]] in the other. In the [[Northern hemisphere]] it is a [[summer]] month and it is a [[winter]] month in the [[Southern hemisphere]].

No other month in a [[common year]] starts on the same day of the week as August, but August starts on the same day of the week as [[February]] in [[leap year]]s. August ends on the same day of the week as [[November]] every year.

During common years, August starts on the same day of the week as [[March]] and [[November]] of the preceding year (and also [[February]], if that year is also a common year) and ends on the same day of the week and [[March]] and [[June]] of the preceding year; during leap years, August starts on the same day of the week as [[June]] and ends on the same day of the week as [[September]], both of the preceding year.

In years that precede common years, August starts and ends on the same day of the week as [[May]] of the following year; in years that precede leap years, August starts on the same day of the week as [[October]], and ends on the same day of the week as [[February]] and [[October]], both of the following year.

'''Art''' is a creative activity by people. The artist hopes that it affects the emotions of people who experience it. Artists express themselves by their art. Some people find art relaxing.  

Many people disagree on how to define art. Some say people are driven to make art due to their inner [[creativity]]. 

Art includes [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[sculpting]], [[photography]], [[Performing arts|performance art]], [[dance]], [[music]], [[poetry]], [[prose]] and [[theatre]].

== Types of art ==
Art is divided into the [[plastic arts]], where something is made, and the [[performing arts]], where something is done by humans in action. The other division is between pure arts, done for themselves, and practical arts, done for a practical purpose, but with artistic content.
*Plastic arts
**Fine art is expression by making something [[Beauty|beautiful]] or appealing to the [[emotion]]s by visual means: [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[printmaking]], [[sculpture]]
**Literature: [[poetry]], creative [[writing]]
*Performing arts
**Performing art including [[drama]] are (expression using the body: [[dance]], [[acting]], [[singing]])
**Auditory art (expression by making [[sound]]s): [[music]], [[singing]]
*Practical arts
** Culinary art (expression by making [[flavor]]s and [[taste]]s): [[cooking]] 
** The practical arts (expression by making things and structures: [[architecture]], [[Movie|filming]], [[fashion]], [[photography]], [[video games]])

== What &quot;art&quot; means ==
Some people say that art is a product or item that is made with the intention of stimulating the human senses as well as the [[mind|human mind]], [[spirit]] and [[soul]].

An artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people, the amount of people who can relate to it, and how much people appreciate it.

The first and broadest sense of &quot;art&quot; means &quot;arrangement&quot; or &quot;to arrange.&quot; In this sense, art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form; or when someone arranges colors next to each other in a painting to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting design.

Art can also be a form of expression of [[emotion]]. The artist may feel a certain emotion and feel that there is no way to express it other than to create something that means something to them. Most of the art created in this case is made for the artist rather than an audience. However, if an audience is able to connect with the emotion as well, then the art work may become publicly successful.Also,art is a way to express something which have a deep meaning inside.

== History of art ==

There are sculptures, [[cave painting]] and [[rock art]] dating from the Upper [[Paleolithic]] era.

All of the great ancient civilizations, such as Ancient [[Egypt]], [[India]], [[China]], [[Greece]], [[Rome]] or [[Arabia]] had works and styles of art. In the [[Middle Ages]], most of the art in [[Europe]] showed people from the [[Bible]] in [[painting]]s, [[stained glass]] windows, and [[mosaic]] tile floors and walls.

[[Islamic]] art includes [[geometric]] patterns, Islamic [[calligraphy]], and [[architecture]]. In [[India]] and [[Tibet]], painted sculptures, dance, and religious painting were done. In China, arts included [[jade]] carving, bronzework, [[pottery]], [[poetry]], calligraphy, music, painting, drama, and fiction. There are many Chinese artistic styles, which are usually named after the ruling dynasty.

In Europe, after the [[Middle Ages]], there was a &quot;[[Renaissance]]&quot; which means &quot;rebirth&quot;. People rediscovered [[science]] and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects. People like [[Michelangelo]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] still painted religious pictures, but they also now could paint mythological pictures too. These artists also invented [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] where things in the distance look smaller than things close up in the picture. This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other.

In the late 1800s, artists in Europe, responding to [[Industrialization|Modernity]] created many new painting styles such as [[Classicism]], [[Romanticism]], [[Realism]], and [[Impressionism]]. The history of twentieth century art includes [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dada]]ism, [[Surrealism]], and [[Minimalism]].

== Roles of art ==

In some [[society|societies]], people think that art belongs to the person who made it, such as Indigenous Aboriginal Australian Art. They think that the artist put his or her &quot;[[talent]]&quot; into the art. In this view, the art is the [[property]] of the artist.

In other societies, people think that art belongs to no one. They think that society has put its [[social capital]] into the artist and the artist's work. In this view, society is a [[collective]] that has made the art, through the artist.

=== Functions of art ===

The [[wikt:simple:function|functions]] of art include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bagdasaryan |first=Nadejda |title=Culturology |year=2000 |language=Russian |ISBN=5-06-003475-5 |pages=511 |chapter=7. Art as a phenomenon of culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1) Cognitive function

:Works of art let us know about what the author knew, and about what the surrounding of the author were like.

2) Aesthetic function

:Works of art are more or less harmonic and bring pleasure, a sensation of beauty.

3) Prognostic function

:Some artists draw what they see the future like, and some of them are right, but most are not...

4) Recreation function

:Art makes us think about it, not about reality; we have a rest.

5) Value function

:What did the artist value? What aims did he like/dislike in human activity? This usually is clearly seen in artists' works.

6) Didactic function

:What message, criticism or political change did the artist wish to achieve?

: ''This page is about the first [[letter]] in the [[alphabet]].
: ''For the indefinite article, see [[Article (grammar)]].''
: ''For other uses of A, see [[A (disambiguation)]]''

{{A-Z}}
[[File:A cursiva.gif|thumb]]
'''A''' is the first letter of the [[English language|English]] [[alphabet]]. The small letter, '''a''', is used as a lower case [[vowel]]. However, the English long '''a''' (ā) is said as a [[diphthong]] of ĕ and y. The same letter of the [[Greek alphabet]] is named [[alpha (letter)|alpha]]. Alpha and [[omega (letter)|omega]], the last letter of the Greek alphabet, means the beginning and the end. In [[musical notation]], the letter A is the symbol of a note in the scale, below [[B]] and above [[G]]. In [[binary]] numbers, the letter A is 01000001.

A is the letter that was used to represent a team in an old [[TV]] show, [[The A-Team]].

==Where it came from==
The earliest letter 'A' has appeared was in the Phoenician alphabet's [[aleph]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; This symbol came from a simple picture of an [[ox]] head. 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- style=&quot;background-color:#EEEEEE; text-align:center;&quot;
! Egyptian
! Phoenician &lt;br&gt;''[[aleph]]''
! Greek &lt;br&gt;''[[Alpha (letter)|Alpha]]''
! Etruscan &lt;br&gt;A
! Roman/Cyrillic &lt;br&gt;A
|- style=&quot;background-color:white; text-align:center;&quot;
|[[File:EgyptianA-01.svg|Egyptian hieroglyphic ox head]]
|[[File:PhoenicianA-01.svg|Phoenician aleph]]
|[[File:Alpha uc lc.svg|65px|Greek alpha]]
|[[File:EtruscanA.svg|Etruscan A]]
|[[File:RomanA-01.svg|Roman A]]
|}

This Phoenician letter helped make the basic blocks of later types of the letter. The Greeks later modified this letter and used it as their letter [[Alpha (letter)|alpha]]. The Greek alphabet was used by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] in northern Italy, and the Romans later modified the Etruscan alphabet for their own language.

==Using the letter==
The letter A has six different sounds. It can sound like æ, in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], such as the word ''pad''. Other sounds of this letter are in the words ''father'', which developed into another sound, such as in the word ''ace''.

==Use in mathematics==
In algebra, the letter &quot;A&quot; along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities.

In geometry, capital A, B, C etc. are used to label [[line segment]]s, [[Line (geomotry)|lines]], etc. Also, A is typically used as one of the letters to label an angle in a triangle.

[[File:Big air Québec 2011.jpg|thumb|This guy is crazy!!!!!]]
'''Air''' is the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]]. Air around us is a mixture of many gases and dust particles. It is the clear [[gas]] in which living things live and [[breathe]]. It has an indefinite shape and volume. It has no [[color]] or [[odor|smell]]. It has [[mass]] and [[weight]]. It is a [[matter]] as it has mass and weight. Air creates [[atmosphere pressure|atmospheric  pressure]]. There is no air in the [[vacuum]] of the [[cosmos]]. 

Air is a [[mixture]] of about 78% [[nitrogen]], 21% [[oxygen]], 0.9% [[argon]], 0.04% [[carbon dioxide]], and very small amounts of other gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://mistupid.com/chemistry/aircomp.htm|title=composition of air}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer, Carl (3 October 2013). Earth’s Oxygen: a mystery easy to take for granted. New York Times. [http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/science/earths-oxygen-a-mystery-easy-to-take-for-granted.html?_r=0]&lt;/ref&gt;  There is an average of about 1% water vapour.

Animals need the [[oxygen]] in the air to live. In the [[human body]], the [[lung]]s give oxygen to the [[blood]], and give back [[carbon dioxide]] to the air. Plants need the carbon dioxide in the air to live. They give off oxygen that humans can breathe again.  

[[Wind]] is moving air.  Air [[air pollution|can be polluted]] by some gases (such as   [[carbon monoxide]]), [[smoke]], and [[wikt:ash|ash]]. This [[pollution]] is one of the reasons for [[global warming]], by causing the &quot;[[greenhouse effect]]&quot;.

Aircraft use [[propeller]]s to move air over a [[wing]], which allows them to [[flight|fly]]. [[Pneumatics]] use [[air pressure]] to move things.Nil

{{shortcut|[[WP:ADMIN]]&lt;br /&gt;[[WP:SYSOP]]&lt;br /&gt;[[WP:A]]&lt;br /&gt;[[WP:MOP]]}}
[[File:Wikipedia Administrator.svg|thumbnail|This is the symbol of a Wikipedia administrator. It shows the site's logo with a [[mop]], as administrators are often linked to [[janitor]]s.]]
'''Administrators''', also called '''admins''' or '''sysops''' ('''sys'''tem '''op'''erators), are users who can use special [[Special:ListGroupRights/Admin|tools]] that help keep Wikipedia running smoothly.  They can use these tools because they are trusted by the community, but this does not make them better or more important than anybody else.  The opinion of an administrator, for example, should not be counted as more important than the opinion of a person who chooses to change Wikipedia with an IP address just because they have administrator rights.

''There are currently {{NUMBEROFADMINS}} administrators.''

=== Administrative tools ===
==== Delete ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|delete]] and undelete pages. Pages can be deleted because of a [[WP:RFD|request for deletion]] or they can be [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Quick deletion|quickly deleted]] under policy. Undeletion requests should be made at [[Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion]].

=====Revision Delete=====
Administrators can also hide [[Help:Diff|revisions]] of a page from public view by deleting them. Only other administrators can see the deleted revisions. Revisions should only be hidden in special cases, listed [[Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Revision deletion|here]].

==== Protect ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Protection policy|protect]], unprotect and change protected pages, including those in the [[:en:Wikipedia:MediaWiki namespace|MediaWiki namespace]], and other users' personal [[Javascript]] or [[CSS]] (.js or .css) files.
* Requests for protection can be made at [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard]]. Please remember that pages are usually protected when there is [[WP:VAND|vandalism]] or an [[WP:edit war|edit war]] happening, and not to prevent vandalism that has not happened.

==== Block ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Blocks and bans|block]] and unblock users who are causing trouble.
* Requests should be made at [[Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress]] but only if the user has been disruptive.  Requests made in [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|bad faith]] may result in you yourself being blocked. Blocks are different to bans.

==== Rollback ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Rollback|rollback changes]]. This lets them quickly undo all the changes by a user to a page if they are the newest changes. The change is automatically marked as a [[Help:small change|small change]] and gives the following [[WP:Change summary|change summary]]:

:'''m''' ''Reverted edits by '''User A''' ('''talk''') to last version by '''User B'''

To use bot rollback, you type in the URL &lt;nowiki&gt;http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Example&amp;bot=1  &lt;/nowiki&gt; replacing Example with the user name, and then you can rollback changes and hide them from the recent changes along with the rolled back edit, but this should only be used for large amounts of vandalism, like with a [[:m:vandalbot|vandalbot]].
* Users can also be given the rollback tool. You can make requests at [[WP:RFRB|requests for rollback]].

==== Import pages ====
They can [[meta:Import|import]] pages from other Wikipedias.

==== View unwatched pages ====
They can see which pages are not on someone's watchlist.

==== Manage userrights ====
They can give some user rights to others. They can add or remove rollback, IP block exempt, flooder, the uploader right, and the patroller right for all accounts.

== Bureaucrat ==
{{shortcut|[[WP:CRAT]]&lt;br&gt;[[WP:BUR]]}}
A '''bureaucrat''' can do a few more things than an administrator, but they should only use these while acting on [[WP:CON|consensus]]. Bureaucrats can give administrator or bureaucrat rights to other users, following a successful request on [[Wikipedia:Requests for permissions]]. On the Simple English Wikipedia bureaucrats can also remove administrator status following a successful request for removal of rights (deadminship), or in certain emergency situations for protection of the wiki. They can also &quot;flag&quot; and un-flag [[Wikipedia:Bot|bots]], which means to hide their contributions from the new changes and put them in the bot group. Bureaucrats were previously able to help users who want to [[:meta:Changing username|change their username]]. These requests were handled on [[Wikipedia:Changing username]]. However, the ability to rename users has been removed from bureaucrats for [[:m:SUL finalization|SUL finalization]]. Now, these requests should be made at [[:m:SRUC|Meta-Wiki]] or on this [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|special page]] where stewards and global renamers will handle them.

== CheckUser ==
A select few administrators have checkuser access. They can see the [[IP address]]es of named editors. They can also see which users edit from certain IP addresses, as well as some information on the [[browser]] used for editing. There are many rules as to who can become a CheckUser, and how CheckUsers have to behave. These rules are listed on the [[m:CheckUser policy|CheckUser policy]] page. CheckUsers can help fight [[vandalism]] and [[WP:Sock puppetry|sock puppetry]] this way. CheckUser requests can be made at [[Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser]].

== Oversighter ==
Certain administrators have oversighter access. Page [[:en:Help:Diff|revisions]] can be hidden or removed from the public history so they can only be seen by other oversighters and [[:m:System administrators|developers]]. The right is a sensitive one, and removes private data that can cause legal problems. There are many rules as to who can become an oversighter, and how oversighters have to behave. These rules are listed on the [[m:Oversight|Oversighter policy]] page. Oversighters can help fight [[wp:VAN|vandalism]] this way. Oversighter requests should only be made privately, and not on Wikipedia. See the [[WP:OS|Oversighter]] page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Spain]] is divided in 17 parts called '''autonomous communities'''. ''Autonomous'' means that each of these autonomous communities has its own Executive Power, its own Legislative Power and its own Judicial Power. These are similar, but NOT the same, to states in the [[United States]] of America, for example.

Spain has fifty smaller parts called provinces. In [[1978]] these parts came together, making the autonomous communities. 
Before then, some of these provinces were together but were broken. The groups that were together once before are called &quot;historic communities&quot;: Catalonia, Basque Country, Galicia and Andalusia.

The Spanish language is the official language in every autonomous community but six, which also have other official languages:
* [[Catalonia]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Occitan language|Occitan]])
* [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencian Community]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]], also called [[Valencian language|Valencian]] there)
* [[Balearic Islands]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]])
* [[Galicia]] ([[Galician language|Galician]])
* [[:en:Basque_Country|Basque Country]] ([[Basque language|Basque]])
* [[Navarre]] ([[basque language|Basque]], but only in the north and near the border with Euskadi)

List of the autonomous communities, with their Capital city (the place where the government has its offices):

* [[Andalusia]] (its capital is [[Sevilla]])
* [[Aragon]] (its capital is [[Zaragoza]])
* [[Asturias]] (its capital is [[Oviedo]])
* [[Balearic Islands]] (its capital is [[Palma de Mallorca]])
* [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] (its capital is [[Vitoria]])
* [[Canary Islands]] (they have two capitals - [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] and [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]])
* [[Cantabria]] (its capital is [[Santander, Spain|Santander]])
* [[Castile-La Mancha]] (its capital is [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]])
* [[Castile and León]] (its capital is [[Valladolid]])
* [[Catalonia]] (its capital is [[Barcelona]])
* [[Extremadura]] (its capital is [[Mérida]])
* [[Galicia]] (its capital is [[Santiago de Compostela]])
* [[La Rioja]] (its capital is [[Logroño]])
* [[Community of Madrid]] (its capital is [[Madrid]])
* [[Region of Murcia]] (its capital is [[Murcia]])
* [[Navarre]] (its capital is [[Pamplona]])
* [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencian Community]] (its capital is [[Valencia]])

Spain also has two cities on the north coast of Africa: [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]. They are called &quot;autonomous cities&quot; and have simultaneously the majority of the power of an autonomous community and also power of provinces and power of municipalities.

[[File:Bombe-rebuild.jpg|thumb|right|A rebuild of a machine made by Alan Turing]]

'''Alan Mathison Turing''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] [[FRS]] ([[London]], 23 June 1912 – [[Wilmslow]], [[Cheshire]], 7 June 1954) was an [[English people|English]] [[mathematician]] and [[computer scientist]]. He was born in [[Maida Vale]], London.&lt;ref&gt;Newman M.H.A. 1955. Alan Mathison Turing. 1912–1954. ''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society'' '''1''': 253. [http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/253]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Young Life and Family ==
Alan Turing was born in Maida Vale, London. His father was part of a family of [[Merchant|merchants]] from Scotland. His mother, Ethel Sara, was the [[daughter]] of an [[engineer]].

=== Education ===
Turing went to St. Michael's, a school at 20 Charles Road, St Leonards-on-sea, when he was six years old.

== Career ==
Turing was one of the people who worked on the first [[computers]]. He was the first person to think of using a computer to do things that were too hard for a person to do. He created the [[Turing machine]] in 1936. The machine was [[Imagination|imaginary]], but it included the idea of a [[computer program]]. 

Turing was interested in [[artificial intelligence]]. He proposed the [[Turing test]], to say when a machine could be called &quot;[[Intelligence|intelligent]]&quot;. A computer could be said to &quot;think&quot; if a human talking with it could not tell it was a machine.&lt;ref&gt;Harnad, Stevan 2008.  [http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/7741 The Annotation game: Turing (1950) on Computing, machinery and intelligence]. In: Epstein, Robert &amp; Peters, Grace (eds) ''Parsing the Turing Test: philosophical and methodological issues in the quest for the thinking computer''. Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Turing worked to break [[Germany|German]] [[cipher]]s (secret messages). Using [[cryptanalysis]], he helped to break the codes of the [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] machine. After that, he solved other German codes.

From 1945 to 1947, Turing worked on the design of the [[ACE (computer)|ACE]] (Automatic Computing Engine) at the [[National Physical Laboratory]]. He presented a paper on 19 February 1946. That paper was &quot;the first detailed design of a [[stored-program computer]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, B. Jack 2006. ''Colossus: The secrets of Bletchley Park's code-breaking computers''. Oxford University Press. p108 ISBN 978-0-19-284055-4&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was possible to build ACE, there were delays in starting the project. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year. While he was at Cambridge, the [[Pilot ACE]] was built without him. It ran its first program on 10&amp;nbsp;May 1950.

== Private life ==
Turing was a [[homosexual]] man. In 1952, he admitted having had sex with a man in [[England]]. At that time, [[homosexual]] acts were illegal. Turing was [[conviction|convicted]]. He had to choose between going to [[jail]] and taking [[hormone]]s to lower his sex drive. He decided to take the hormones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Letters of Note: Yours in distress, Alan |last=Turing |first=Alan |year=1952 |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/yours-in-distress-alan.html |archivedate=December 16, 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CxLiSeL9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his punishment, he became [[erectile dysfunction|impotent]]. He also grew [[breast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Alan Turing: The Enigma The Centenary Edition | publisher=Princeton University | author=Andrew Hodges | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, a [[private member's bill]] was put before the [[House of Lords]] to grant Turing a statutory [[pardon]].&lt;ref name=Guardian-Pardon&gt;{{cite web|title=Parliamentary bill launched for Alan Turing pardon|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/jul/25/alan-turing-private-members-bill-lord-sharkey|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, the government supported it.&lt;ref name=turingguardian19july2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk-news/2013/jul/19/enigma-codebreaker-alan-turing-posthumous-pardon|title=Enigma codebreaker Alan Turing to be given posthumous pardon|publisher=The Guardian|date=19 July 2013|author=Nicholas Watt}}&lt;/ref&gt; A royal pardon was granted on 24&lt;!-- Mercy is effective from 24 December although it was announced on the night of 23rd --&gt; December 2013.&lt;ref name=turingindependent24dec2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/alan-turing-gets-his-royal-pardon-for-gross-indecency--61-years-after-he-poisoned-himself-9023116.html|title=Alan Turing gets his royal pardon for 'gross indecency' – 61 years after he poisoned himself|publisher=The Independent|date=23 December 2013|Author=Oliver Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=turingpardoncryptome24dec2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/2013/12/turing-pardon.pdf|title=(Archived copy of) Royal Pardon for Alan Turing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
In 1954, after suffering for two years, Turing died from [[cyanide]] poisoning. The cyanide came from either an [[apple]] which was poisoned with [[cyanide]], or from water that had cyanide in it. The reason for the confusion is that the police never tested the apple for cyanide.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, Andrew 1983. ''Alan Turing: the enigma''. London: Burnett Books, p488. ISBN 0-04-510060-8&lt;/ref&gt;It is also suspected that he committed suicide. 

The treatment forced on him is now believed to be very wrong. It is against [[medical ethics]] and international laws of [[human rights]]. In August 2009, a [[petition]] asking the [[British Government]] to apologise to Turing for punishing him for being a homosexual was started.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thousands call for Turing apology |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8226509.stm |publisher=BBC News  |date=31&amp;nbsp;August 2009 |accessdate=31 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Petition seeks apology for Enigma code-breaker Turing | url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/09/01/alan.turing.petition/index.html | publisher=CNN | date = 01&amp;nbsp;September 2009 | accessdate =1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition received thousands of signatures.&lt;ref&gt;The petition was only open to UK citizens.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] acknowledged the petition. He called Turing's treatment &quot;appalling&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = PM's apology to codebreaker Alan Turing: we were inhumane | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/11/pm-apology-to-alan-turing | publisher=The Guardian| date = 11 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andouille''' is a type of [[pork]] [[sausage]]. It is spicy (hot in taste) and smoked. There are different kinds, all with different combinations of pork [[meat]], [[fat]], [[intestines]] (tubes going to the [[stomach]]), and [[tripe]] (the wall of the stomach). Andouille sausage first came from [[France]] or [[Germany]] (no-one is sure), but the name indicates that it may have come out from France, and the most famous sort in the [[United States|USA]] is the &quot;Cajun&quot; style. 

Other sorts are &quot;French andouille&quot; and &quot;German andouille&quot;; they are less spicy than Cajun. Cajun has extra [[sodium chloride|salt]], [[black pepper]], and [[garlic]]. Andouille makers smoke the sausages over pecan wood and sugar cane for a maximum of seven or eight hours, at about 175 degrees Fahrenheit (80 degrees Celsius).

'''Farming''' is growing [[crop]]s or keeping animals by people for [[food]] and [[raw material]]s. Farming is a part of [[agriculture]].

== History ==
Agriculture started thousands of years ago, but no one knows for sure how old it is.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Tudge argues &quot;from at least 40,000 years ago... people were managing their environment to such an extent that they can properly be called 'proto-farmers'&quot;. Tudge, Colin 1998. ''Neanderthals, bandits and farmers: how agriculture really began''. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, p3. ISBN 0-297-84258-7&lt;/ref&gt; The development of farming gave rise to the [[Neolithic Revolution]] whereby people gave up [[nomad]]ic [[hunting]] and settled in what became [[cities]].

Agriculture and [[domestication]] probably started in the [[Fertile Crescent]] (the [[Nile]] Valley, The [[Levant]] and [[Mesopotamia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Harris, David (ed) 1996. ''The origins and spread of agriculture and pastoralism in [[Eurasia]]: crops, fields, flocks and herds''. University College London Press. ISBN 1-56098-675-1&lt;/ref&gt; The area called Fertile Crescent is now in the countries of [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], and [[Egypt]]. [[Wheat]] and [[barley]] are some of the first crops people grew. People probably started agriculture slowly by planting a few crops, but still gathered many foods from the wild. People may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change. Farming can feed many more people than [[hunter-gatherer]]s can feed on the same amount of land.

== Kinds of farming ==
Agriculture is not only growing food for people and animals, but also growing other things like [[flower]]s and [[nursery]] [[plant]]s, manure or dung, [[animal hides]] (skins or furs), [[leather]], animals, fungi, [[fiber]]s ([[cotton]], [[wool]], [[hemp]], and [[flax]]), [[biofuel]]s , and [[drug]]s (bio[[pharmaceuticals]], [[marijuana]], [[opium]]).

Many people still live by [[subsistence agriculture]], on a small farm.  They can only grow enough food to feed the farmer, his family, and his animals.  Extra food or animals are sold for money or other things the farmer cannot grow. The [[yield]] is the amount of food grown on a given amount of land, and it is often low. This is because subsistence farmers are generally less [[education|educated]], and they have less [[money]] to buy equipment. [[Drought]] and other problems sometimes cause [[famine]]s. Where yields are low, [[forests]] are sometimes cut to provide new land to grow more food. This is good in the short term, but can be bad for the country and the surrounding [[environment]] over many years.

In rich countries, farms are often much larger. The amount produced on farms has got bigger in the last one hundred years because farmers are able to grow better [[variety (botany)|varieties]] of plants, use more fertilizer, use more water, and more easily control weeds and pests. Many farms also use machines, which cut down on the number of people needed to farm the land. There are fewer farmers in rich countries, but the farmers are able to grow more. 

This kind of [[intensive agriculture]] comes with its own set of problems. Farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers, [[pesticide]]s (chemicals that kill bugs), and [[herbicide]]s (chemicals that kill weeds). These chemicals can [[pollute]] the [[soil]] or the water. They can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals, causing outbreaks of these pests. The soil can be damaged by [[erosion]] (blowing or washing away), salt buildup, or loss of structure. [[Irrigation]] (adding water from rivers) can pollute water and lower the water table. These problems have all got solutions, and modern young farmers usually have a good technical education.

=== Agriculture techniques ===
* [[Fertilizer]]s
* [[Crop rotation]]
* [[Weed]] removal
* [[Breeding]]
* [[Agricultural fencing|Fencing]]
* [[Ranching]]

Farmers select plants with better yield, taste, and [[nutrition]]al value.  They also choose plants that can survive [[plant disease]] and drought, and are easier to harvest.  Centuries of [[artificial selection]] and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. The crops produce better yield with other techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, irrigation).

Some companies have been searching for new plants in poor countries, and genetically modify these plants to improve them. They then try to patent the seeds and sell them back to the poor countries.

New plants were created with [[genetic engineering]]. One example of [[genetic engineering]] is modifying a plant to resist a herbicide.

== Food ==
It is important for there to be enough food for everyone. The food must also be safe and good. People say it is not always safe, because it contains some chemicals. Other people say intensive agriculture is damaging the environment. For this reason, there are several types of agriculture.
* Traditional agriculture is mostly done in poor countries.
* Intensive agriculture is mostly done in countries with more money. It uses pesticides, machinery, chemical fertilizers. 
* Organic farming is using only natural products such as compost and green manure. 
* Integrated farming is using local resources, and trying to use the waste from one process as a resource in another process.

[[Agricultural policy]] focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production. At the policy level, common goals of agriculture include:

* [[Food safety]]: to be sure that the food supply is safe.
* [[Food security]]: to be sure there is enough food for everyone.
* [[Food quality]]: to be sure the food is of good quality.

== Problems in agriculture ==
There are some serious problems that people face trying to grow food today.
These include:
* [[Erosion]]
* [[Diseases]]
* [[Pests]]
* [[Weed]]s
* [[Drought]]
* [[Rainfall]]

== Crops ==
The major crops produced in the world in 2002, are maize (corn), wheat, rice, and cotton.

*[[Maize]] 624 millions of metric tons
*[[Wheat]] 570 millions of metric tons
*[[Rice]] 381.1 millions of metric tons
*[[Cotton]] 96.5 millions of metric tons

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Arithmetic''' is a name for working with [[number]]s. It is a part of [[mathematics]]. The four basic arithmetic operations are [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and [[Division (mathematics)|division]].

Harder arithmetic includes working with [[signed number]]s, [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], and [[decimal]]s, and taking [[power (math)|powers]] and [[root (math)|roots]].

Most people learn arithmetic in [[primary school]], but some people do not learn arithmetic and others forget the arithmetic they learned. Many jobs require a knowledge of arithmetic, and many employers complain that it is hard to find people who know enough arithmetic. A few of the many jobs that require arithmetic include [[carpenter]]s, [[plumber]]s, [[automobile mechanic|auto mechanics]], [[accountant]]s, [[architect]]s, [[Medical doctor|doctors]], and [[nurse]]s. Arithmetic is needed in all areas of mathematics, [[science]], and [[engineering]]. 

A [[calculator]] can be used to do arithmetic. [[Computer]]s can do it more quickly, which is one reason [[Global Positioning System]] receivers have a small computer inside. 

== Examples of arithmetic ==

* 2 + 3 = 5 (adding is [[commutative property|commutative]]: 2 + 3 is the same as 3 + 2)

* 7 - 5 = 2 (subtracting is not commutative: 7 - 5 is different from 5 - 7)

* 3 * 4 = 12 (multiplying is commutative: 3 * 4 is the same as 4 * 3)

* 6 / 2 = 3 (dividing is not commutative: 6 / 2 is different from 2 / 6)

[[Image:Addition.gif|thumb|220px|Addition ]]

'''Addition''' is the [[mathematics|mathematical]] way of putting things together.

== Arithmetic ==

In [[arithmetic]], addition is finding the total of two or more [[number]]s. The sign for addition is &quot;+&quot;. The name for the sign &quot;+&quot; is &quot;plus&quot;.  
Another name for the total is the [[sum]].

=== Counting examples ===
For example, there are [[wikt:object|objects]] in two [[group]]s. The objects are small circles: &quot;o&quot;. One group has five of these objects. The other group has 3 of these objects. To find the total number of objects in both groups, the objects can be counted. Another way to find the number of objects in both groups is to add the numbers in each group.  

====Adding====

Another method is to add the numbers of objects in group A and group B, since they are already counted. In symbols:

:{{math|5 + 3}}

There are [[rule]]s for adding numbers that people [[learn]]. There are also rules for adding numbers that are built into machines ([[binary adder]]). The rule says that:

:{{math|{{aao|5|3|+}}}}

In another counting example, Sally and Bill have 2 children. Sally and Bill get 3 more children. Sally and Bill have added three children to their two children and now have five children.

'''Vertical Addition'''

The animation above demonstrates the addition of seven hundred and eighty six and four hundred and sixty seven, the problems digits have been separated into units, tens and hundreds ([[place value]]).  First the units 6 and 7 are added together to make 13, so 1 ten and 3 units, the 3 is written below and the 1 ten is carried to the tens column. Next in the tens column the 1, 8 and 6 are added together to make 15 tens, so 1 hundred and 5 tens, the 5 is written below and the 1 hundred is carried to the hundreds column. Finally in the hundreds column 1, 7 and 4 are added together to make 12 hundreds, so 1 thousand and 2 hundreds, the 2 is written below and the 1 thousand is carried to the thousand column. Giving the answer one thousand two hundred and fifty three.

===A measurement example===
Tom wants to know the distance between his house and Sally's house. Bob's house is 300 meters  east of Tom's house. Sally's house is 120 meters east of Bob's house:

:Tom's house&lt;------------300 meters--------------&gt;Bob's house&lt;-----120 meters-----&gt;Sally's house

The distance from Tom's house to Sally's house can be found by adding the distances already measured. The distance from Tom's house to Bob's house added to the distance from Bob's house to Sally's house is the same as the distance from Tom's house to Sally's house. That is, three hundred (300) meters plus 120 meters.
:{{math|{{aao|300|120|+}}}}

== Addition as increase ==
Addition can also mean to make bigger.

=== Example of addition as increase ===
* For example, Tom has a house. Tom puts a new room on the house. This new room is called an addition.

* John is making [[food]]. To make the food [[taste]] better, John puts [[salt]] in the food. That is, John adds salt to the food. The [[salt]] is a [[food additive]] or addition to the food.

'''Australia''' is a [[country]] in the [[southern hemisphere]] between the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Indian Ocean]].  Its official name is the '''Commonwealth of Australia'''. Australia is the sixth biggest country in the world by landmass, and is part of the [[Oceania|Oceanic]] and [[Australasia]]n regions. The Australian [[emblem]] is a flower called the Golden Wattle. 

23{{ndash}}24 million people live in Australia, and about 80% of them live on the east coast. About 60% live in and around the mainland state capitals of [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Adelaide]]. Australia's capital city is [[Canberra]].

Australia is known for its [[mining]] and for its production of [[wool]]. Australia is the world's largest producer of [[bauxite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mams.rmit.edu.au/0wzm6liriybr1.PDF|title=Alcola World Alumina Australia|publisher=MAMS.RMIT.edu.au|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia, [[New Zealand]], [[New Guinea]] and other islands on the Australian [[tectonic plate]] are together called [[Australasia]]. They form one of the world's great [[ecozone]]s. When other Pacific islands are included, the term is [[Oceania]].

== Geography ==
[[File:As-map.png|thumbnail|left|Map of Australia]]
Australia's landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometers is on the [[Indo-Australian Plate|Indo-Australian plate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Turner | first=Kate | year=2008 | title=National Geographic Australia | publisher=Horupu | location=Tokyo | page=pp.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The continent of Australia, including the island of Tasmania, was separated from the other continents of the world many millions of years ago. Because of this, many [[animals]] and [[plants]] live in Australia that do not live anywhere else. These include animals like the [[kangaroo]], the [[koala]], the [[emu]], the [[kookaburra]], and the [[platypus]].

People first arrived in Australia more than 50,000 years ago. These native Australians are called the [[Australian Aborigine]]s. For the history of Australia, see [[History of Australia]].

Most of the Australian colonies, having been settled from [[Britain]], became mostly independent democratic states in the 1850s and all six combined as a federation on 1 January 1901. The first [[Prime Minister of Australia]] was [[Edmund Barton]] in 1901. Australia is a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It is a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Queen Elizabeth II|Elizabeth II]] as Queen of Australia and Head of State and a [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] who is chosen by the Prime Minister to carry out all the duties of the Queen in Australia.

=== Regions and cities ===
{{Other pages|List of Cities in Australia}}
Australia has six states, two major mainland territories, and other minor territories. The states are [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Cummins | first=Brian R. | year=1990 | title=Australia | publisher= the Australian Government Publishing Service | location=Canberra | pages= 16-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two major mainland territories are the [[Northern Territory]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT).

In 2013 according to world bank Australia had just over 23.13 million people. Most Australians live in cities along the coast, such as [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Darwin, Australia|Darwin]], [[Hobart]] and [[Adelaide]]. The largest inland city is [[Canberra]], which is also the nation's capital. The largest city is Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Oceania South Pole | author= Tanabe Yu | year= 1997 | publisher= Asakura Bookstore | location= Shinjyuku ward | page= 3179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia is a very big country, but much of the land is very dry, and the middle of the continent is mostly [[desert]]. Only the areas around the east, west and south coast have enough rain and a suitable [[climate]] (not too hot) for many [[farm]]s and [[cities]].

== History ==
=== Aboriginal people ===
[[File:Corroboree.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Arrernte men of Central Australia in a [[Corroboree]] in 1900.]]

The [[Australian Aborigine|Australian Aboriginal]] people arrived in Australia about 50,000 years ago or even earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Hesp, Patrick A. ''et al'' 1999. Aboriginal occupation on Rottnest Island, Western Australia, provisionally dated by aspartic acid racemisation assay of land snails to greater than 50 ka. ''Australian Archaeology'', No 49 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/000236.html |title=Stone Pages Archaeo News: Australia colonized earlier than previously thought? |first= |last= |work=stonepages.com |year=2003 |accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The history of Australia |author=Takao Fujikawa |year=2004|publisher=Yuhikaku ARMA |location=Tokyo |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the arrival of British settlers in 1788, the Aboriginal people lived by hunting and gathering food from the land. They lived in all sorts of climates and managed the land in different ways. An example of Aboriginal land management was the [[Cumberland Plain]] where Sydney is now. Every few years the Aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees.{{Citation}} This meant that a lot of grass grew back, but not many big trees. Kangaroos like to live on grassy plains, but not in forests. The kangaroos that lived on the plain were a good food supply for the Aboriginal people. Sometimes, Aborigines would name a person after an animal, and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population.

Aboriginal people did not usually build houses, except huts of grass, leaves and bark. They did not usually build walls or fences, and there were no horses, cows or sheep in Australia that needed to be kept in pens. The only Aboriginal buildings that are known are fish-traps made from stones piled up in the river, and the remains of a few stone huts in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]].{{Citation}} The Aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth. In some parts of Australia the people used sharp flaked-stone spearheads, but most Aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood. Australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making. The [[boomerang]] was used in some areas for sport and for hunting.

The Aboriginal people did not think that the land belonged to them. They believed that they had grown from the land, so it was like their mother, and they belonged to the land.

=== Terra Australis ===
In the 1600s, [[Dutch people|Dutch]] merchants traded with the islands of [[Batavia]] (now [[Indonesia]]), to the north of Australia and several different Dutch ships touched on the coast of Australia. The Dutch governor, van Diemen, sent [[Abel Tasman]] on a voyage of discovery and he found [[Tasmania]], which he named [[Van Diemen's Land]]. Its name was later changed to honour the man who discovered it.

The [[British Government]] was sure that there must be a very large land in the south, that had not been explored. They sent Captain [[James Cook]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. His ship, ''[[HMS Endeavour]]'', carried the famous scientists, Sir [[Joseph Banks]] and Dr Solander who were going to [[Tahiti]] where they would watch the planet [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] pass in front of the [[Sun]]. Captain Cook's secret mission was to find &quot;[[Terra Australis]]&quot; (the Land of the South).

The voyage of discovery was very successful, because they found [[New Zealand]] and sailed right around it. Then they sailed westward. At last, a boy, William Hicks, who was up the mast spotted land on the [[horizon]]. Captain Cook named that bit of land [[Point Hicks]]. They sailed up the coast and Captain Cook named the land that he saw &quot;New South Wales&quot;. At last they sailed into a large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food. Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were. They collected hundreds of plants to take back to England.

Captain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life. He saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit. But there were no houses and no fences. In most parts of the world, people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land. But the Aboriginal people did not own the land in that way. They belonged to the land, like a baby belongs to its mother. Captain Cook went home to England and told the government that no-one owned the land. This would later cause a terrible problem for the Aboriginal people.
